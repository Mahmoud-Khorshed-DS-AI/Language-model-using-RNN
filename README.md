# Language-model-using-RNN
 In this project, I want to predict whatâ€™s the next word after I write a sentence, I want to build a language model which can predict what's the next word and what's the probability of this word being the next word, The model will consider the context of the last 50 words of a particular sentence and predict the next possible word. 

We will be using methods of natural language processing, language modeling, and deep learning. We will start by analyzing the data followed by the pre-processing of the data. We will then tokenize this data and convert them into sequences and finally, we'll build and train some deep learning models and compare their performance with each other.
